Sprints are time-limited competitions that give field techs a focused window to earn points for confirming assets. Running regular sprints keeps confirmation rates high and surfaces stale inventory before it becomes a compliance problem.

Sprints are managed from **Admin → Sprints**.

## Creating a sprint

1. Open the app and navigate to **Admin**.
2. Scroll to the **Sprints** section.
3. Tap **+ New Sprint**.
4. Fill in the form:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Sprint name** | Yes | Something descriptive — e.g. "May Blitz" or "Q2 Week 1" |
| **Description** | No | Optional context for your team |
| **Start date** | Yes | Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`. Sprint begins at midnight UTC on this date. |
| **End date** | Yes | Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`. Sprint ends at 11:59 PM UTC on this date. |

5. Tap **Create Sprint**.

The new sprint appears immediately. If the start date is today or in the past, it becomes the **active sprint** and the LIVE badge appears.

<Warning>
  Only one sprint can be active at a time. If a sprint is already running, schedule the next one to start the day after it ends. The system will reject overlapping sprints.
</Warning>

## Active sprint display

While a sprint is running:

- A **LIVE** badge appears next to the sprint name in the Admin → Sprints list.
- A **sprint banner** appears on the home screen of all techs in your company, showing the sprint name, countdown to end, and their personal score and rank.
- The **Sprint** leaderboard period becomes available in the Most Wanted → Leaderboard tab.
- Assets confirmed during the sprint are locked and cannot be re-confirmed by another tech until the sprint ends.

## Ending a sprint early

If you need to stop a sprint before its scheduled end date:

1. Open **Admin → Sprints**.
2. Find the sprint with the **LIVE** badge.
3. Tap **End Early**.

The sprint's end date is updated to now. Points are preserved — all scoring history remains intact. The sprint moves to the past sprints list immediately.

<Note>
  Ending a sprint early does not delete it. All points and confirmation history tied to the sprint are preserved for reporting and audit purposes.
</Note>

## Viewing past sprints

Up to five recent sprints are listed below the active sprint card. Each shows the sprint name and date range. For detailed per-sprint scoring, use the Leaderboard tab in Most Wanted and select the **Sprint** period while the sprint is still active.

## Sprint strategy tips

- **1–2 week windows** tend to produce the best results. Long enough for full building coverage, short enough to maintain urgency.
- **Name sprints clearly** — techs see the sprint name on their home screen throughout the competition.
- **Schedule the next sprint before the current one ends** to avoid a gap where no sprint banner is visible.
- **Target stale periods** — the 🔥 10-point assets are devices not confirmed in 90+ days. A sprint focused on clearing those is worth more than one that just confirms recently-seen devices.
